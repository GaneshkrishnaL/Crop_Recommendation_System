# Crop_Recommendation_System
A simple machine learning project that recommends best crop to grow. Helps farmers to make an informed decision before starting the cultivation of crops.
<h1> Motivation </h1>
Precision agirculture is in trend nowadays. Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that uses the data of soil charachteristics, soil types, crop yield data, weather conditions and suggests the farmers with the most optimal crop to grow in their farms for maximum yield and profit. This technique can reduce the crop failures and will help the farmers to take informed decision about their farming strategy.
<h1> GOAL </h1>
To recommend optimum crops to be cultivated by farmers based on several parameters and help them make an informed decision before cultivation.
<h1> About the Data </h1>
The data used in this project is made by augmenting and combining various publicly available datasets of India like weather, soil, etc. It contains significant parameters like NPK values, temperature, humidity, rainfall, ph value and lable-rice,paddy,maize, etc. This data is relatively simple with very few but useful features unlike the complicated features affecting the yield of the crop.

The data have Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Pottasium and pH values of the soil. Also, it also contains the humidity, temperature and rainfall required for a particular crop.
